## Carried Applicability Risks

| Risk | Owner Phase | Evidence Expectation | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Exact validator implementation path was deferred by applicability and resolved in design as `scripts/validate_security_applicability.ps1`. | `apply` | Implement and reference the PowerShell validator; verify it remains static and scoped to Markdown/YAML structure and references. | `planned` |

| Enriched applicability fields could accidentally force security-design for valid no-impact changes. | `verify` | Verify valid no-impact proof skips security-design while invalid no-impact proof blocks routing. | `planned` |

## Exception Handling

No approved exceptions are recorded for this security design. Any future exception that attempts to satisfy missing mandatory evidence must include all shared contract fields: `status: exception-approved`, `guidelineId`, `approver`, `approvedAt`, `acceptedRiskRationale`, `mitigationOrFollowUp`, and `evidenceGap`.

## Archive Gate Notes

- Mandatory applicable controls block archive until evidence is verified or a complete approved exception is recorded.
- Incomplete exceptions do not satisfy archive readiness.
- Archive evidence must preserve catalog snapshot identity, guideline IDs, taxonomy categories, source references, operational severity, expected evidence status, and residual risks.
- Valid no-impact artifacts remain compatible with downstream routing: they skip `security-design.md` only when explicit no-impact proof and validation metadata are complete.
