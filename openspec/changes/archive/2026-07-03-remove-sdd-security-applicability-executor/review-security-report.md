## Summary

Security review passed with warnings. The three mandatory governance controls from `security-design.md` were validated against apply progress, test design, tasks, general review, changed-file evidence, and active contracts. Runtime security categories remain not applicable because this change modifies SDD workflow contracts and generated artifacts, not application runtime behavior.

Warnings are carried for unavailable runtime tooling and the user-approved dirty workspace context. Neither warning is a security blocker because the report scopes evidence to this change and does not treat unavailable tools as passing evidence.

## General Review Handoff

`review-report.md` records `PASS WITH WARNINGS` with zero blocking failures and routes this phase to `review-security`. Its non-blocking findings are relevant to this security review:

- Runtime tests, coverage, lint, typecheck, format, and build commands are unavailable and were not run.
- Workspace context includes approved dirty/pre-existing files, so downstream phases must scope evidence to this change and avoid blocking solely on unrelated dirty files.

The general review also confirms no new `security-applicability.md` was produced for this change and that active contract searches found only legacy/read-only references.

## Exceptions

None. No approved exception is required because all mandatory governance controls comply and all runtime categories have explicit not-applicable rationale.

## Blockers and Non-Blocking Findings

### Blockers

None.

### Non-Blocking Findings

| Finding | Severity | Affected Control | Evidence Location | Follow-up |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Runtime test, coverage, lint, typecheck, format, and build tooling are unavailable. | Warning | `SDD-GOV-003`; verification evidence hygiene | `openspec/config.yaml` lines 17-46 and 71-76; `apply-progress.md` lines 71-79; `test-design.md` lines 5 and 68 | Verification must continue reporting unavailable tooling as unavailable, not passed. |
| Workspace contains user-approved dirty/pre-existing context outside this change. | Warning | Review evidence scoping | `state.yaml` lines 52-57; `review-report.md` lines 21-24 | Verification should scope evidence to this change and avoid treating unrelated/pre-existing dirty files as blockers. |

## Unavailable Tooling

Runtime tooling is unavailable by repository contract:

- Test runner: unavailable.
- Coverage: unavailable.
- Linter: unavailable.
- Type checker: unavailable.
- Formatter: unavailable.
- Build command: unavailable.

This report does not treat unavailable runtime tooling as pass evidence. Security review relies on static read-back, targeted file searches, task/apply evidence, general review evidence, and manual artifact hygiene inspection.

## Validation Notes

- Required inputs inspected: `security-design.md`, `review-report.md`, `apply-progress.md`, `test-design.md`, `tasks.md`, `state.yaml`, `openspec/config.yaml`, shared status/persistence/security/OpenSpec contracts, orchestrator naming contract, archive-only applicability validator, changed-file status, and targeted absence/search evidence.
- `security-applicability.md` was not created for this change.
- Repo-local launchable `sdd-security-applicability` agent and skill paths are absent.
- Remaining `security-applicability` references reviewed for this phase are legacy/read-only/archive data references or historical archive content.
- `nextRecommended` is `verify` because there are no blocking security findings.
