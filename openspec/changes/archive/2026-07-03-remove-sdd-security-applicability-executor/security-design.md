classificationRationale: >-
  This change is security-impacting at the SDD governance/workflow-contract level because it removes the repo-local
  security-applicability executor and moves new-change classification authority into mandatory security-design.md.
  It does not introduce runtime application behavior, secrets, authentication, sessions, database access, file handling,
  or logging behavior.

    preserves mandatory downstream evidence expectations for governance controls, and sets nextRecommended to test-design.

## Classification Summary

This change is **security-impacting** because it changes the governance location of security classification for new SDD changes: `security-design.md` becomes mandatory and authoritative, while `security-applicability.md` becomes legacy/read-only data only.

The change is **not runtime security-impacting**. It does not add or modify authentication, sessions, sensitive data/PAN handling, secrets, runtime authorization, file handling, database access, or runtime logging.

## Control Matrix

| Control ID | Category | Mandatory | Required Control | Evidence Owners | Residual Risk | Exception |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SDD-GOV-001` | `workflow-governance` | Yes | New changes use `security-design.md` as mandatory classification authority and do not recreate `security-applicability.md`. | `test-design`, `apply`, `verify` | Stale global opencode copies may remain outside repo scope. | None |
| `SDD-GOV-002` | `workflow-governance` | Yes | Legacy applicability artifacts remain readable only as archive data and do not weaken mandatory security design/review. | `test-design`, `apply`, `verify` | Archived mentions may confuse search unless active wording is explicit. | None |
| `SDD-GOV-003` | `evidence-hygiene` | Yes | Generated SDD evidence avoids secrets, credentials, production identifiers, and unnecessary sensitive details. | `test-design`, `verify` | Future manual edits could accidentally paste sensitive snippets. | None |

## Catalog Category Decisions

| Category | Guideline | Decision | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `authentication` | `SEC-AUTH-001` | Not applicable | No identity, credential, login, recovery, MFA, or impersonation behavior changes. |
| `sessions` | `SEC-SESS-001` | Not applicable | No cookie, token, session lifecycle, revocation, renewal, or fixation behavior changes. |
| `sensitive-data-pan` | `SEC-DATA-001` | Not applicable | No PAN, PII, confidential data, masking, retention, transmission, or storage behavior changes. |
| `secrets` | `SEC-SECRET-001` | Not applicable to runtime | No runtime secret handling changes; evidence hygiene still requires avoiding secret leakage in artifacts. |
| `permissions-access-control` | `SEC-ACCESS-001` | Not applicable | No role, ownership, authorization, privilege, or protected-resource behavior changes. |
| `files` | `SEC-FILE-001` | Not applicable | No runtime upload, download, generated export, path, or file validation behavior changes. |
| `database-access` | `SEC-DB-001` | Not applicable | No query, migration, persistence, tenant isolation, or reporting behavior changes. |
| `sensitive-logging` | `SEC-LOG-001` | Not applicable to runtime | No runtime log/error/trace behavior changes; evidence hygiene still requires avoiding sensitive artifact content. |

## Evidence Expectations

| Control ID | Evidence Type | Owner Phase | Status | Detail |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SDD-GOV-001` | `test-design-check` | `test-design` | `planned` | Plan static checks proving active routing reaches security-design and never launches `sdd-security-applicability`. |
| `SDD-GOV-001` | `implementation-reference` | `apply` | `planned` | Cite changed agents, shared contracts, and specs that remove active applicability executor references. |
| `SDD-GOV-001` | `verification-evidence` | `verify` | `planned` | Record text-search and diff evidence for deleted launch sources and mandatory security-design routing. |
| `SDD-GOV-002` | `test-design-check` | `test-design` | `planned` | Plan checks that legacy applicability refs are read-only/archive data only. |
| `SDD-GOV-002` | `implementation-reference` | `apply` | `planned` | Cite preservation of legacy refs without active dependency or successor mapping. |
| `SDD-GOV-002` | `verification-evidence` | `verify` | `planned` | Verify no routing/status contract normalizes applicability into a runnable phase. |
| `SDD-GOV-003` | `test-design-check` | `test-design` | `planned` | Plan artifact inspection for secret-like or sensitive-data examples. |
| `SDD-GOV-003` | `verification-evidence` | `verify` | `planned` | Verify changed artifacts contain only repository paths, workflow terms, and catalog IDs. |

## Carried Applicability Risks

- Stale global opencode copies may still expose the retired executor outside repo scope. Owner: `apply`. Expected evidence: document repo-local scope and stale-copy caveat.
- Legacy archive mentions may confuse future searches or status readers. Owner: `verify`. Expected evidence: active contracts label applicability as legacy/read-only data and keep new-change routing through security-design.
- Archive-only validator naming may be mistaken for active new-change validation. Owner: `verify`. Expected evidence: validator references are archive-only and do not block new-change routing.

## Archive Gate Notes

- Mandatory governance controls block archive until evidence is verified or a complete approved exception is recorded.
- Runtime catalog categories are not applicable for this change, but their N/A rationale must remain archive-readable.
- `security-applicability.md` must not be created for this new change.
- `nextRecommended` is `test-design`.
