## Verification Summary

Verification read the proposal, seven delta specs, technical design, mandatory `security-design.md`, mandatory `test-design.md`, completed `tasks.md`, `apply-evidence.md`, non-blocking `review-report.md`, non-blocking `review-security-report.md`, OpenSpec config, and current repository evidence.

Machine-readable archive routing summary: `schemaName=gentle-ai.sdd-verify-report`; `schemaVersion=1`; `changeName=replace-security-applicability-with-mandatory-security-design`; `verdict=PASS WITH WARNINGS`; `nextRecommended=archive`; `criticalFindings=0`; `artifactStore=openspec`; all implementation tasks complete (`12/12`, `0` incomplete); `review-report.md` non-blocking (`0` blocking findings); `review-security-report.md` non-blocking (`0` blocking findings).

Result: **PASS WITH WARNINGS**. No critical findings were identified. All implementation tasks are checked complete. Both review gates are readable and non-blocking. Runtime test/lint/type/format/coverage/build tooling is unavailable by repository configuration, so verification evidence is static/manual plus the PowerShell security-design validator; unavailable runtime tooling is reported explicitly and is not counted as successful runtime evidence.

## Completeness Table

| Artifact / Evidence | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `openspec/config.yaml` | Read | Repository is an AI agent/skill distribution with no runtime test runner, linter, formatter, type checker, coverage command, or build command. |
| `proposal.md` | Read | Defines mandatory `design -> security-design -> test-design` and `review -> review-security -> verify` workflow. |
| Seven delta specs | Read | All listed spec files were inspected and mapped below. |
| `design.md` | Read | Confirms canonical active DAG and affected files/contracts. |
| `security-design.md` | Read / validated | Mandatory canonical security artifact with 8 compact SEC rows and 4 mandatory applicable controls. |
| `test-design.md` | Read | Contains TD-001..TD-028, all mandatory. |
| `tasks.md` | Complete | 12 implementation tasks checked; 0 unchecked implementation tasks found. Proposal success criteria checkboxes are not task checkboxes. |
| `apply-evidence.md` | Read | Captures static command evidence, unavailable tooling, TD coverage, and security control evidence. |
| `review-report.md` | Read | Non-blocking general review consumed by summary only; full 96-control matrix is not duplicated here. |
| `review-security-report.md` | Read | Non-blocking security review consumed by summary only; row-level report is summarized here without duplication. |

## Review Evidence Citation

| Review Artifact | Verdict | Blocking State | Evidence Summary | Verification Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `openspec/changes/replace-security-applicability-with-mandatory-security-design/review-report.md` | PASS WITH WARNINGS | 0 blocking failures; 2 non-blocking findings | General review inspected all SDD artifacts, changed-file context, completed task state, apply evidence, security-design validator output, and unavailable runtime tooling. | Accepted as non-blocking prerequisite. Summary only; the 96-control matrix remains owned by the review report. |
| `openspec/changes/replace-security-applicability-with-mandatory-security-design/review-security-report.md` | PASS WITH WARNINGS | No blocking security findings | Security review validated all 8 compact SEC rows, confirmed applicable controls implemented with static/manual evidence, preserved N/A rationale, and cited unavailable runtime tooling plus CRLF warning as non-blocking. | Accepted as mandatory non-blocking security prerequisite. Summary only; row validation remains owned by the security review report. |

## Spec Compliance Matrix

| Spec | Requirements / Scenarios | Evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sdd-review-security-workflow` | Mandatory security review after non-blocking general review; persisted `review-security-report.md`; all security rows validated; boundary with general review preserved. | `review-security-report.md` is readable, `PASS WITH WARNINGS`, recommends verify, validates 8 rows, cites but does not duplicate general review. | Covered by static/manual evidence. |
| `sdd-security-applicability-workflow` | New changes do not run or produce active `security-applicability.md`; legacy artifacts read-only; no-impact proof moves into `security-design.md`; validator targets security design for new changes. | Design/proposal/specs state new DAG; state has empty `securityApplicability`; active grep/read-back showed legacy-only references; `scripts/validate_security_design.ps1` passed. | Covered by static/manual evidence. |
| `sdd-security-design-workflow` | Every new change requires `security-design.md` after design and before test design; direct classification from proposal/spec/design; mandatory evidence/exceptions/archive gates. | `security-design.md` exists, validates, records classification, catalog identity, matrix, controls, exceptions none, archive gates, and `nextRecommended: test-design`. | Covered by static/manual evidence. |
| `sdd-test-design-workflow` | `test-design.md` after mandatory security design; maps specs, design risks, and security matrix to mandatory checks; verify compares test/security evidence. | `test-design.md` exists with TD-001..TD-028 and Security Control Coverage; verify matrix below maps every case. | Covered by static/manual evidence. |
| `sdd-review-workflow` | Apply routes to review; non-blocking review routes to security review; blocking review returns to apply; review does not own security matrix. | `review-report.md` reports non-blocking verdict and `Next recommendation: review-security`; security review consumed it. | Covered by static/manual evidence. |
| `sdd-execution-persistence-contracts` | New DAG `apply -> review -> review-security -> verify -> archive`; state refs for `securityDesign` and `securityReviewReport`; verify/archive consume both review reports without owning matrices. | State includes `securityDesign`, `securityReviewReport`, empty legacy `securityApplicability`; this report consumes both reviews by summary only; state updated to verify/archive. | Covered by static/manual evidence. |
| `sdd-security-guideline-catalog` | Catalog supports mandatory evidence model, matrix vocabulary, review-safe evidence, validator contract, and authority boundary. | `security-design.md` preserves catalog snapshot metadata and valid vocabulary; validator passed; security review confirmed all 8 rows and safe evidence. | Covered by static/manual evidence. |

## Test-Design Coverage Matrix

| Test Case | Coverage Status | Verification Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TD-001 | Covered | README, orchestrator/status/spec evidence use active DAG `explore? -> propose/spec -> design -> security-design -> test-design -> tasks -> apply -> review -> review-security -> verify -> archive`. |
| TD-002 | Covered | Applicability workflow spec and skill are legacy/archive-only; no active new-change `security-applicability.md` artifact is required. |
| TD-003 | Covered | Design phase routes to mandatory `security-design`; direct design-to-test-design route is not the active path for new changes. |
| TD-004 | Covered | Security-design agent/skill/contract plus this artifact require classification, catalog identity, matrix rows, controls, evidence, statuses, exceptions, archive gates, and `nextRecommended: test-design`. |
| TD-005 | Covered | Test-design workflow consumes mandatory `security-design.md` before task planning. |
| TD-006 | Covered | `test-design.md#security-control-coverage` maps applicable controls and N/A rows. |
| TD-007 | Covered | `review-report.md` routes non-blocking review to `review-security`; not directly to verify. |
| TD-008 | Covered | `agents/sdd/sdd-review-security.md`, `skills/sdd-review-security/SKILL.md`, and persisted `review-security-report.md` exist/read back. |
| TD-009 | Covered | `review-security-report.md` validates every `security-design.md` row with answer, lifecycle, evidence, and observations. |
| TD-010 | Covered | General review matrix is not duplicated in security review or this verification report. |
| TD-011 | Covered | State/status/persistence evidence includes `securityDesign`, `securityReviewReport`, `review-security`, and no active `securityApplicability` dependency. |
| TD-012 | Covered | Verify consumes both review reports by summary; archive route requires non-blocking review and security review evidence. |
| TD-013 | Covered | OpenSpec conventions/source specs document mandatory `security-design.md`, `test-design.md`, and `review-security-report.md`; applicability is legacy-only. |
| TD-014 | Covered | Changed agents/skills/shared contracts consistently use the new route; general review confirmed no blocking consistency findings. |
| TD-015 | Covered | README and source OpenSpec specs have been synchronized for the final workflow and compatibility model. |
| TD-016 | Covered | New validator target is `scripts/validate_security_design.ps1`; legacy applicability validator is not required for new phase success. |
| TD-017 | Covered | Security-design validator executed and passed for this change artifact. |
| TD-018 | Covered with static contract evidence | Negative fixture behavior is documented in test design/apply evidence and validator contract; no separate runtime test runner exists. |
| TD-019 | Covered | `scripts/validate_security_applicability.ps1` remains present as legacy/archive compatibility only. |
| TD-020 | Covered | Stale-route grep/read-back found active route evidence for new DAG; old matches are historical/archive or explicitly legacy-scoped. |
| TD-021 | Covered | State/status examples and current state use camelCase refs and valid native tokens. |
| TD-022 | Covered | `review-security-report.md` exists, is readable, non-blocking, and cited before verify/archive. |
| TD-023 | Covered | Evidence/report contracts use paths, summaries, command names, and redacted/placeholders rather than raw sensitive values. |
| TD-024 | Covered | Secret-looking literal grep over Markdown found only the documented search terms in `test-design.md`; no actual secret values were observed. |
| TD-025 | Covered | Workflow gates enforce mandatory `security-design` and `review-security` before downstream verify/archive. |
| TD-026 | Covered | Security review/report contracts and this report cite locations and observations without raw sensitive payloads. |
| TD-027 | Covered | N/A rows for auth, sessions, files, and database preserve rationale and evidence in `security-design.md` and security review. |
| TD-028 | Covered with warning | Unavailable runtime test/lint/type/format/coverage/build tooling is explicitly reported and not treated as passed evidence. |

## Security Evidence Matrix

| Guideline ID | Design Classification | Review-Security Result | Verification Evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SEC-AUTH-001` | N/A / `not-applicable` | N/A, no finding | Rationale states no login, identity, MFA, impersonation, recovery, or protected URL behavior is changed. | Verified N/A rationale. |
| `SEC-SESS-001` | N/A / `not-applicable` | N/A, no finding | Rationale states no cookies, tokens, refresh, logout, revocation, or session lifetime behavior is changed. | Verified N/A rationale. |
| `SEC-DATA-001` | Yes / planned mandatory control | Yes / implemented; warning only to preserve static verification boundary | Apply/test/review evidence uses paths, sections, summaries, command names, and redacted placeholder policy; no PAN/PII examples observed. | Verified with warning: runtime tooling unavailable. |
| `SEC-SECRET-001` | Yes / planned mandatory control | Yes / implemented; warning only to preserve no-secret evidence boundary | Contracts and reports prohibit raw secrets; grep found only documented placeholder search terms in the test plan, not real secret values. | Verified with warning: runtime tooling unavailable. |
| `SEC-ACCESS-001` | Yes / planned mandatory control | Yes / implemented; CRLF warning non-blocking | New DAG/status/contracts enforce mandatory `security-design` and `review-security` gates before verify/archive. | Verified with warning: CRLF normalization notice. |
| `SEC-FILE-001` | N/A / `not-applicable` | N/A, no finding | Rationale states repository edits do not add upload/download/export/path/file-authorization behavior. | Verified N/A rationale. |
| `SEC-DB-001` | N/A / `not-applicable` | N/A, no finding | `openspec/config.yaml` and design confirm no database runtime, queries, migrations, or data access behavior. | Verified N/A rationale. |
| `SEC-LOG-001` | Yes / planned mandatory control | Yes / implemented; warning only to preserve safe evidence boundary | Review-security/archive/report contracts require audit-useful evidence via locations and observations without raw secrets, PAN, credentials, tokens, or unnecessary sensitive context. | Verified with warning: runtime tooling unavailable. |

## Correctness and Design Coherence

| Area | Expected | Observed | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Active DAG | `explore? -> propose/spec -> design -> security-design -> test-design -> tasks -> apply -> review -> review-security -> verify -> archive` | Proposal/design/README/source specs/orchestrator evidence align with this route. | Compliant. |
| Legacy applicability | Read-only compatibility only, no active new-change artifact/gate. | State has empty `securityApplicability`; active requirements route classification into `security-design.md`; legacy references are scoped. | Compliant. |
| Review boundary | Verify consumes summaries, not matrices. | This report summarizes review verdicts and does not duplicate the 96-control matrix or security review row matrix. | Compliant. |
| Mandatory security design | Exists for this new change and validates. | Validator passed; artifact includes classification, catalog snapshot, rows, controls, evidence, exceptions, N/A rationale, and archive gate notes. | Compliant. |
| Task completion | All implementation tasks complete before verify. | `tasks.md` has tasks 1.1-4.2 checked complete. | Compliant. |
| Runtime evidence | Do not invent unavailable commands. | Runtime tooling is explicitly unavailable; only available static commands were run. | Compliant with warnings. |

## Skipped or Degraded Dimensions

- Runtime tests, unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests, linter, formatter, type checker, coverage, and build were not run because `openspec/config.yaml` reports no available tooling and no commands. These are unavailable and are not counted as successful runtime evidence.
- Full runtime behavioral compliance is not claimed. This repository's change is documentation/prompt/contract/validator focused, so verification relies on static/manual artifact evidence and the available PowerShell validator.
- The general 96-control review matrix and security-review row matrix were intentionally not duplicated; verification cites their verdict/blocking summaries only.

## Issues

### Critical

None.

### WARNING

| ID | Finding | Evidence | Blocking? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| WARN-001 | Runtime test/lint/type/format/coverage/build tooling is unavailable by repository configuration. | `openspec/config.yaml#testing`; `apply-evidence.md`; `review-report.md`; `review-security-report.md`. | No. Reported explicitly; no unavailable command is treated as passed. |
| WARN-002 | `git diff --check` passed but emitted a CRLF normalization warning for `agents/sdd/sdd-design.md`. | Fresh `git diff --check` during verify. | No. No whitespace error was reported. |

### SUGGESTION

None.

## Final Verdict

**PASS WITH WARNINGS**

`next_recommended: archive`

Archive is recommended because there are no critical findings, all implementation tasks are complete, mandatory security-design validation passed, both review reports are non-blocking, and all warnings are explicitly non-blocking.
