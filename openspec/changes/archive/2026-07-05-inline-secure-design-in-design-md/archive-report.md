## Summary

The change `inline-secure-design-in-design-md` was archived successfully. Delta specs were synced into OpenSpec source specs before moving the active change folder into the dated archive destination.

This archive intentionally uses `openspec/changes/archive/2026-07-05-inline-secure-design-in-design-md/design.md#secure-development-design` as the mandatory security-design input. The standalone `security-design.md` artifact is absent and non-blocking for this change because the embedded source was validated by `review-security-report.md` and `verify-report.md`.

Security-design validation metadata:

- Source: `design.md#secure-development-design`.
- Validator evidence: `review-security-report.md` validates the embedded source against `skills/_shared/security-guideline-catalog.md`.
- Status: PASS WITH WARNINGS; no blockers.
- Checked at: security review and verify reports in this archive.
- Catalog snapshot identity: `security-guidelines-initial-user-snapshot-2026-06-30`, catalog version `1`, taxonomy version `1`.
- Notes: all 8 SEC rows are present; no approved exceptions are used; N/A rows include rationale; applicable rows preserve downstream evidence obligations.

## Unavailable Tooling Evidence

`openspec/config.yaml` records this repository as an AI agent/skill distribution with no configured runtime test runner, coverage command, linter, type checker, formatter, or build command. Archive preserves that evidence as unavailable tooling only; it is not passing evidence.

## Archive Verification

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Active change folder removed from `openspec/changes/inline-secure-design-in-design-md/` | Passed |
| Archive destination created without overwriting an existing folder | Passed |
| Required archive artifacts present | Passed |
| Embedded security-design source present and validated | Passed |
| General and security review reports non-blocking | Passed |
| Verify report archive-ready with no critical or blocking findings | Passed |
| Source specs updated/preserved | Passed |

## Completion

The SDD cycle is complete. No further SDD phase is recommended for this change.
