**Change**: `inline-secure-design-in-design-md`  
**Version**: N/A  
**Mode**: Standard verification (`strict_tdd: false`)  
**Verdict**: PASS WITH WARNINGS  
**Next recommended**: archive

This verification is archive-ready because warnings are non-blocking, all 11 tasks are complete, both review reports are non-blocking, and there are 0 blocking verification issues.

| --- | --- |
| Required input artifacts inspected | proposal, 7 specs, `design.md#secure-development-design`, `test-design.md`, `tasks.md`, `review-report.md`, `review-security-report.md`, `state.yaml`, `openspec/config.yaml` |
| Tasks total | 11 |
| Tasks complete | 11 |
| Tasks incomplete | 0 |
| General review verdict | PASS WITH WARNINGS; 0 blocking failures; next recommendation `review-security` |
| Security review verdict | PASS WITH WARNINGS; no blockers; next recommendation `verify` |
| Security design source | `openspec/changes/inline-secure-design-in-design-md/design.md#secure-development-design` |
| Standalone `security-design.md` | Absent and non-blocking for this change; legacy/read-only only |

### General Review Evidence Citation

`openspec/changes/inline-secure-design-in-design-md/review-report.md` was consumed as prerequisite evidence. It reports `PASS WITH WARNINGS`, `Blocking failures: 0`, `Non-blocking findings: 1`, and `Next recommendation: review-security`. Its evidence summary states that proposal, seven delta specs, embedded secure design, test design, task/apply checkbox evidence, state, config, and changed-file context were inspected. Verification does not reproduce or re-score the 96-control review matrix.

### Security Review Evidence Citation

`openspec/changes/inline-secure-design-in-design-md/review-security-report.md` was consumed as prerequisite evidence. It reports `PASS WITH WARNINGS`, validates `design.md#secure-development-design`, finds all 8 catalog rows exactly once, records no incomplete exceptions, lists no blockers, and recommends `verify`. Verification does not reproduce or re-score the security review matrix.

### Correctness (Static Evidence)

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| New changes no longer launch `sdd-security-design` | ✅ Implemented | README, orchestrator, status contract, design/test/task/review/verify/archive skills mark standalone phase legacy/read-only. |
| `design.md` requires full 8-row secure development design section | ✅ Implemented | Design skill, shared security contract, catalog, and source specs require embedded rows. |
| `sdd-review-security` validates embedded rows and writes evidence matrix | ✅ Implemented | Review-security skill/report validate `design.md#secure-development-design` and persist `review-security-report.md`. |
| Legacy standalone archives remain readable | ✅ Implemented | Persistence/OpenSpec/status/security contracts preserve legacy/read-only refs. |
| Active validator removal | ✅ Implemented | `scripts/validate_security_design.ps1` is deleted; remaining active contracts do not require it. |
| Task completion | ✅ Implemented | All 11 task checkboxes are complete. |
| Review prerequisites | ✅ Implemented | General and security review reports are present, readable, and non-blocking. |

### Coherence (Design)

| Decision | Followed? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Inline security authority in `sdd-design` | ✅ Yes | Embedded `## Secure Development Design` is present and downstream consumers read it. |
| Routing: design to test-design | ✅ Yes | Active DAG and phase success routing skip standalone security-design for new changes. |
| Security validation through review-security | ✅ Yes | Security review validates embedded rows and produces report evidence. |
| Legacy compatibility | ✅ Yes | Legacy refs and skill remain read-only/archive compatibility; new workflow does not require standalone artifacts. |
| Static/manual testing strategy | ✅ Yes, with warning | Repository has no runtime tooling; static/manual evidence is complete for this governance-only change. |

### Skipped / Degraded Dimensions

| Dimension | Status | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Runtime test execution | Degraded | No test runner or `rules.verify.test_command` is configured. |
| Build execution | Degraded | No build command is configured. |
| Coverage | Degraded | Coverage tooling is unavailable. |
| Lint/typecheck/format | Degraded | Quality tooling commands are unavailable. |
| Full runtime scenario compliance | Degraded | This change modifies Markdown/SDD governance contracts; verification relies on static/manual artifact evidence, review reports, and task/apply evidence. |

### Issues Found

**Blocking verification issues**: None.

**WARNING**:
- Runtime tests, build, coverage, lint, typecheck, and formatter commands are unavailable. Missing tooling is excluded from positive evidence. Static/manual evidence is complete for this governance-only change.

**SUGGESTION**:
- If this repository later gains a test runner or documentation validator, add explicit `rules.verify.test_command` / quality commands so future SDD verification can include executable evidence.

### Verdict

PASS WITH WARNINGS

All required artifacts were inspected; all 11 tasks are complete; both prerequisite review reports are present and non-blocking; embedded secure-design rows and mandatory test-design cases are covered by static/manual evidence; and 0 blocking verification issues were found. The only warning is unavailable runtime/quality tooling, which is explicitly reported as unavailable evidence only. This result is archive-ready.
