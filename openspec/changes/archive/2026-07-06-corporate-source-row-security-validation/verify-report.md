## Final Verdict

PASS WITH WARNINGS. Archive readiness is true.

Formal verification confirms 13/13 tasks complete, 0 critical findings, 0 blocking findings, non-blocking general review evidence, non-blocking security review evidence, and 155/155 corporate Source IDs validated exactly once by security review.

## Prerequisite Review Evidence

| Artifact | Verdict | Blockers | Verification use |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| `openspec/changes/corporate-source-row-security-validation/review-report.md` | PASS WITH WARNINGS | 0 | Consumed as general review handoff; matrix ownership stays in review. |
| `openspec/changes/corporate-source-row-security-validation/review-security-report.md` | PASS WITH WARNINGS | 0 | Consumed as security review handoff; source-row matrix ownership stays in review-security. |

Security review summary consumed: 8/8 compact `SEC-*` rows comply; 155/155 corporate Source IDs are represented exactly once; duplicate IDs 0; unknown IDs 0; missing IDs 0; compact mappings valid; unsafe evidence findings 0; exceptions 0; source-row route `verify`.

## Execution Evidence

| Whitespace/static diff check | `git diff --check` | PASS with Git line-ending warnings |
| Source row count inspection | Static inspection of `review-security-report.md` | PASS: 155 entries, 155 unique IDs, 0 duplicates |
| Task checkbox inspection | Static inspection of `tasks.md` | PASS: 13 checked tasks, 0 unchecked tasks |

## Proposal and Spec Coverage

| Area | Evidence | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Source ID expansion, mapping, exact-once validation | `design.md#secure-development-design`; `test-design.md`; `review-security-report.md` | PASS |
| Correct blocker routing for missing IDs, mappings, schema, evidence, and unsupported N/A | Delta specs; shared security contract; phase skills | PASS |
| Compact `SEC-*` controls preserved | Catalog, design, security review | PASS |
| Persistence compatibility preserved | `openspec/specs/sdd-execution-persistence-contracts/spec.md`; shared persistence contract | PASS |

Compliance summary: 32/32 delta spec scenarios are covered through approved static/manual evidence for this Markdown instruction-contract repository.

## Security Evidence

| Control | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `SEC-AUTH-001` | PASS |
| `SEC-SESS-001` | PASS |
| `SEC-DATA-001` | PASS |
| `SEC-SECRET-001` | PASS |
| `SEC-ACCESS-001` | PASS |
| `SEC-FILE-001` | PASS |
| `SEC-DB-001` | PASS |
| `SEC-LOG-001` | PASS |

Security evidence summary: 8/8 mandatory compact security controls covered; 0 exceptions; 0 blockers. Corporate source-row validation is consumed from `review-security-report.md`: 155/155 exact-once rows, 0 missing, 0 duplicate, 0 unknown, safe evidence pass.

## Test-Design Coverage

| Case range | Result |
| --- | --- |
| TD-001 through TD-016 mandatory cases | PASS: 16/16 covered |
| TD-017 through TD-018 advisory cases | PASS: 2/2 covered |

## Warning Summary

| Warning | Blocking | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Runtime/build/lint/type/format/coverage tooling is unavailable by repository configuration, so evidence is static/manual. | No | `openspec/config.yaml#testing`; `review-report.md`; `review-security-report.md` |

## Archive Readiness

Archive readiness is true: tasks complete, general review non-blocking, security review non-blocking, formal verification passing with warnings only, 0 critical findings, 0 blocking findings, and source-row validation complete.
