## Verification Report

**Change**: `selective-secure-design-controls`  
**Version**: OpenSpec delta specs for `sdd-design-workflow`, `sdd-review-security-workflow`, `sdd-security-guideline-catalog`, `sdd-test-design-workflow`, and `sdd-execution-persistence-contracts`  
**Mode**: Standard verification. Strict TDD is inactive. Runtime/build/lint/type/format/coverage tooling is unavailable by repository configuration, so verification uses static/manual read-back evidence only and does not claim unavailable tooling passed.

### Completeness

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Proposal | Present: `openspec/changes/selective-secure-design-controls/proposal.md` |
| Delta specs | 5/5 present |
| Design | Present, with mandatory `## Secure Development Design` |
| Test design | Present |
| Tasks total | 11 revised tasks |
| Tasks complete | 11 |
| Tasks incomplete | 0 |
| Apply progress | Present; reports no deviations and no issues |
| General review | `PASS WITH WARNINGS`; blocking failures `0`; next `review-security` |
| Security review | `PASS WITH WARNINGS`; blockers `0`; next `verify` |
| Verification verdict | `PASS WITH WARNINGS` |

### General Review and Security Review Evidence

| Artifact | Consumed Verdict | Blocking State | Evidence Summary | Report Link |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| General review | `PASS WITH WARNINGS` | Blocking failures: `0` | Confirms the corrected secure-design section is narrative only, all revised tasks are complete, and runtime tooling is unavailable rather than passing. | `openspec/changes/selective-secure-design-controls/review-report.md` |
| Security review | `PASS WITH WARNINGS` | Blockers: `0` | Confirms narrative design parsing, exact-once compact/source-row validation, safe evidence, supported `N/A`, and warning-only unavailable tooling. | `openspec/changes/selective-secure-design-controls/review-security-report.md` |

Verification cites the review summaries only. It does not duplicate the full 96-control general review matrix, the security compact matrix, or the full 155-row corporate Source ID matrix.

### Source-Row Verdict / Warning Consumption

| Required Evidence | Observed Evidence | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Catalog snapshot identity/path | `skills/_shared/security-guideline-catalog.md`; snapshot `security-guidelines-initial-user-snapshot-2026-06-30`; catalog version `1`; taxonomy version `1` | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| Expected Source ID count | Catalog and security review both state `155` expected Source IDs | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| Exact-once Source ID coverage | Static read-back counted `155` source rows, `155` unique, no duplicates; security review metadata states `sourceRowActualCount: 155`, `sourceRowCoverage: exact-once` | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| Compact mapping status | Static read-back counted `8` compact rows; security review metadata states `compactGuidelineExpectedCount: 8`, `compactGuidelineActualCount: 8` | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| Safe-evidence status | Security review metadata states `safeEvidence: pass`, `unsafeEvidenceRows: 0` | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| `N/A` justification status | Security review states unsupported `N/A`, missing justification, and unsupported omitted-category findings were not found; metadata states `unsupportedNaRows: 0` | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| Exceptions | `None`; no approved security exceptions required | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| Warnings | Runtime test runner, build, lint, typecheck, formatter, and coverage tooling unavailable | ⚠️ WARNING only |
| Source-row blockers | None reported in security review | ✅ COMPLIANT |

### Build & Tests Execution

No runtime commands were executed because `openspec/config.yaml#testing` explicitly reports no configured runner or quality command.

### Secure Development Design Shape Validation

| Check | Observed Evidence | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `design.md#Secure Development Design` exists | Section begins at `design.md` line 85 | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| Narrative-only secure design | Section contains headings and prose rules for Classification, Sensitive Data/PAN, Secrets, Permissions/Access Control, Sensitive Logging, and Exception/Evidence Policy | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| No YAML/JSON/schema in secure design | Static read-back found no forbidden `yaml`, `json`, `schemaName`, or `sourceRows` markers in the secure-design section | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| No control table / compact matrix / Source ID matrix | Static read-back found no `Guideline ID` or `Source ID` table headers in the secure-design section | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| No all-row `N/A` bookkeeping | Secure design explains omitted runtime categories as changed-surface rationale and delegates exhaustive `N/A` validation to review-security | ✅ COMPLIANT |

### Spec Compliance Matrix

| Domain / Requirement | Scenario Coverage | Evidence | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sdd-design-workflow`: Embedded Secure Development Design | Applicable category rules; no-impact rationale; source IDs not planned in design; category rules replace compact matrix | `design.md#secure-development-design`; `skills/sdd-design/SKILL.md`; `agents/sdd/sdd-design.md`; source spec sync | ✅ COMPLIANT via static/manual evidence |
| `sdd-review-security-workflow`: Security Review Artifact | Persisted report schema, report-owned compact/source matrices, design YAML not required | `review-security-report.md`; `skills/sdd-review-security/SKILL.md`; `agents/sdd/sdd-review-security.md` | ✅ COMPLIANT via static/manual evidence |
| `sdd-review-security-workflow`: Security Matrix and Source Row Validation | 8 compact controls and 155 Source IDs materialized exactly once; blockers absent | `review-security-report.md#security-row-validation`; `review-security-report.md#corporate-source-row-validation`; count script output | ✅ COMPLIANT via static/manual evidence |
| `sdd-security-guideline-catalog`: Catalog boundary and inventory | Catalog owns taxonomy, snapshot identity, 155 Source ID inventory, safe evidence, compact mappings | `skills/_shared/security-guideline-catalog.md`; `openspec/specs/sdd-security-guideline-catalog/spec.md` | ✅ COMPLIANT via static/manual evidence |
| `sdd-test-design-workflow`: Narrative-rule planning | Test design consumes narrative rules and rejects design schema/matrix dependencies | `test-design.md`; `skills/sdd-test-design/SKILL.md`; `agents/sdd/sdd-test-design.md` | ✅ COMPLIANT via static/manual evidence |
| `sdd-execution-persistence-contracts`: Active artifact semantics | New-change boundary is narrative design plus review-security report; legacy security artifacts remain read-only data | `openspec/specs/sdd-execution-persistence-contracts/spec.md`; `state.yaml` refs | ✅ COMPLIANT via static/manual evidence |

Because this repository is a Markdown SDD contract repository with no configured runner, these scenarios are verified by static/manual read-back evidence rather than runtime tests. The unavailable runtime evidence remains a warning, not a pass.

### Security Evidence Matrix

| Control / Guideline | Expected Evidence | Observed Evidence | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SEC-AUTH-001` | Omitted runtime auth validated by review-security, not design rows | `review-security-report.md` marks auth-related rows `N/A` or applicable workflow-gate rows with safe evidence; no blockers | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| `SEC-SESS-001` | Omitted runtime sessions validated by review-security, not design rows | `review-security-report.md` marks session rows `N/A` with scope rationale; no blockers | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| `SEC-DATA-001` | Safe evidence for sensitive data/PAN | `design.md#sensitive-datapan-rules`; `test-design.md#security-control-coverage`; `apply-progress.md#security-evidence`; security review safe-evidence pass | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| `SEC-SECRET-001` | No raw secrets in evidence | `design.md#secrets-rules`; `apply-progress.md#security-evidence`; security review `unsafeEvidenceRows: 0` | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| `SEC-ACCESS-001` | Denial-by-default blocker routing | `design.md#permissions--access-control-rules`; `review-security-report.md#missed-category--omission-validation`; no source-row blockers | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| `SEC-FILE-001` | Omitted runtime files validated by review-security | `review-security-report.md` marks file rows `N/A` with scope rationale; no blockers | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| `SEC-DB-001` | Omitted runtime database access validated by review-security | `review-security-report.md` marks database rows `N/A` or workflow-routing rows with safe evidence; no blockers | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| `SEC-LOG-001` | Safe audit/report evidence and warning preservation | `design.md#sensitive-logging-rules`; `apply-progress.md#security-evidence`; `review-security-report.md#non-blocking-findings` | ✅ COMPLIANT |

**Security evidence summary**: 8/8 compact controls covered by review-security prerequisite evidence; 0 exceptions; 0 blockers.

### Test-Design Coverage Matrix

| Case ID | Severity | Expected Evidence | Observed Evidence | Result |

| TD-016 | mandatory | Regression search for obsolete design/test-design schema requirements | Grep/read-back summary confirms remaining matches are prohibitions, review-security ownership, or historical compatibility | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| TD-017 | mandatory | Catalog inventory exact-once Source ID validation | Catalog expected count `155`; review-security `155` rows, `155` unique, no duplicates | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| TD-018 | non-mandatory | Warning-only evidence remains visible downstream | Non-blocking unavailable-tooling warning preserved in review, security review, and verify | ⚠️ WARNING preserved |

**Test-design summary**: 17/17 mandatory cases covered by static/manual evidence; 1/1 non-mandatory case preserved as a warning, not a blocker.

### Correctness (Static Evidence)

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| New designs include only applicable secure-design categories plus classification context | ✅ Implemented | Design includes Sensitive Data/PAN, Secrets, Permissions/Access Control, and Sensitive Logging rules; omitted runtime categories are rationale only. |
| Design no longer requires all eight compact controls or all non-applicable Source IDs | ✅ Implemented | Secure design contains no compact matrix, Source ID matrix, or all-row `N/A` bookkeeping. |
| Security review exhaustively reports applicable/non-applicable compact and Source ID rows | ✅ Implemented | Security review metadata: 8 compact rows, 155 Source IDs, exact-once coverage. |
| Security review blocks missed applicable controls | ✅ Implemented | Review-security skill/spec define blockers; report states no missed applicable runtime category was found. |
| Skills, shared contract, specs, and adapter prompts state the same boundary | ✅ Implemented | Read-back confirms design/test-design prohibit schema/matrix duties and review-security owns exhaustive validation. |

### Coherence (Design)

| Decision | Followed? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Narrative secure design | ✅ Yes | `design.md#secure-development-design` is prose-only by static read-back. |
| Exhaustive validation owner | ✅ Yes | `review-security-report.md` owns compact/source matrices and exact-once validation. |
| Test-design consumption | ✅ Yes | Test-design consumes applicable narrative rules and rejects design schema/matrix dependencies. |
| Compatibility | ✅ Yes | Historical `security-design` / `security-applicability` refs are read-only compatibility data, not active successors. |

### Skipped / Degraded Dimensions

| Dimension | Status | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Runtime tests | Skipped / unavailable | No runtime test runner configured. |
| Build | Skipped / unavailable | No build command configured. |
| Lint | Skipped / unavailable | No linter configured. |
| Type check | Skipped / unavailable | No type checker configured. |
| Format | Skipped / unavailable | No formatter configured. |
| Coverage | Skipped / unavailable | No coverage command configured. |
| Runtime behavior compliance | Not applicable | Proposal/design state no runtime application code, API, auth, session, file, database, logging implementation, or dependency behavior changed. |

### Issues Found

**CRITICAL**: None.  
**WARNING**: Runtime test runner, build, lint, typecheck, formatter, and coverage tooling are unavailable; this verification therefore uses static/manual evidence and does not claim unavailable tools passed.  
**SUGGESTION**: None.

### Verdict

`PASS WITH WARNINGS`

All revised tasks are complete, design/test-design/spec/skill/adapter contracts enforce the narrative no-YAML boundary, review-security owns and validates the 8 compact controls plus all 155 Source IDs exactly once, no source-row blockers remain, and the only warning is explicitly unavailable runtime tooling. The change is eligible to proceed to archive.
