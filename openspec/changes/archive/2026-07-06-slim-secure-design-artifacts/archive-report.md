## Executive Summary

The `slim-secure-design-artifacts` change is archived after completing proposal, specs, design, test-design, tasks, apply, general review, security review, and verify gates. Verification passed with warnings, `archiveReady: true`, 12/12 tasks complete, 0 critical findings, 0 blocking findings, non-blocking review reports, and corporate source-row validation complete.

The OpenSpec source specs were already synced before archive with this change's accepted delta requirements. This archive step verified the synced requirements, wrote this closure report, and preserved the active change folder as the dated OpenSpec audit trail.

## Archive Gates

| Gate | Evidence | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Action context | Repo-local mode; allowed edit root is the workspace root. | PASS |
| Required artifacts | `proposal.md`, five delta specs, `design.md`, `test-design.md`, `tasks.md`, `apply-progress.md`, WU1-WU4 apply evidence, `review-report.md`, `review-security-report.md`, `verify-report.md`, and `state.yaml`. | PASS |
| Task completion | `tasks.md` marks 12/12 implementation tasks complete with no unchecked implementation tasks. | PASS |
| General review | `review-report.md` verdict is PASS WITH WARNINGS with 0 blocking failures. | PASS WITH WARNINGS |
| Security review | `review-security-report.md` verdict is PASS WITH WARNINGS with 8/8 compact `SEC-*` rows, 155/155 Source IDs materialized exactly once, 0 duplicate IDs, 0 unknown IDs, 0 missing IDs, 0 unsafe-evidence findings, and 0 exceptions. | PASS WITH WARNINGS |
| Verification | `verify-report.md` verdict is PASS WITH WARNINGS, `archiveReady: true`, 0 critical findings, and 0 blocking findings. | PASS WITH WARNINGS |
| Embedded secure design | `design.md#secure-development-design` is present and includes compact SEC rows, catalog identity, `expectedSourceIdCount: 155`, grouped source-row coverage, safe-evidence policy, N/A policy, validation metadata, and archive gate notes. | PASS |
| Legacy security artifacts | Standalone `security-design.md`, `security-applicability.md`, and `scripts/validate_security_design.ps1` are not required for this active new-change archive. | PASS |
| Runtime/build/lint/type/format/coverage tooling | Unavailable by repository configuration; preserved as non-blocking warning and not treated as passing evidence. | WARNING |

## Specs Synced

| Domain | Action | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sdd-design-workflow` | Already updated before archive | Main spec contains 2 modified requirements: `Secure Design Source ID Coverage` and `Design Preserves Compact Summary`. |
| `sdd-test-design-workflow` | Already updated before archive | Main spec contains 2 modified requirements: `Source Row Test Planning` and `Source Row N/A and Warning Evidence`. |
| `sdd-review-security-workflow` | Already updated before archive | Main spec contains 1 modified requirement: `Exhaustive Source Row Security Review`. |
| `sdd-security-guideline-catalog` | Already updated before archive | Main spec contains 2 modified requirements: `Corporate Source Row Inventory` and `Shared Security Contract Source Row Schema`. |
| `sdd-execution-persistence-contracts` | Already updated before archive | Main spec contains 2 modified requirements: `Verify Source Row Consumption` and `Archive Source Row Preservation`. |

No delta removals, renames, or destructive merge operations were detected. No archive-time source-spec edit was required because Work Unit 4 had already synced the main OpenSpec specs and this archive gate verified those requirements are present.

## Source-Row Audit Trail Preserved

| Evidence area | Preserved result |
| --- | --- |
| Source-row applicability | Corporate source-row coverage applies. |
| Catalog identity | Snapshot `security-guidelines-initial-user-snapshot-2026-06-30`, catalog version `1`, taxonomy version `1`, source `skills/_shared/security-guideline-catalog.md`. |
| Expected expanded Source ID count | 155 expected Source IDs. |
| Exact-once coverage | `review-security-report.md` records 155 rows, 155 unique Source IDs, 0 duplicate, 0 missing, and 0 unknown IDs. |
| Compact mappings | Valid compact mappings are `SEC-AUTH-001`, `SEC-SESS-001`, `SEC-DATA-001`, `SEC-SECRET-001`, `SEC-ACCESS-001`, `SEC-FILE-001`, `SEC-DB-001`, and `SEC-LOG-001`. |
| Mandatory evidence | 8/8 compact controls covered; source rows supported by design, test-design, apply evidence, changed-file context, and review handoff. |
| Safe evidence | Evidence uses review-safe paths, anchors, summaries, command summaries, and sanitized observations only; unsafe raw secrets, credentials, PAN, PII, tokens, private keys, connection strings, and confidential values remain blockers. |
| N/A evidence / justification | Design declares no not-applicable guidelines; unsupported `N/A` remains blocking for future changes. |
| Exceptions | 0 exceptions recorded; no accepted evidence gaps were archived. |
| Non-blocking warnings | Runtime/build/lint/type/format/coverage tooling unavailable by repository configuration; CRLF-to-LF normalization noise preserved from review/verify. |
| Review-security verdict link | `review-security-report.md` verdict PASS WITH WARNINGS, source-row route `verify`, blockers none. |
| Verify source-row consumption | `verify-report.md` consumes non-blocking security evidence and preserves 155/155 exact-once source-row status without owning the full matrix. |
| Legacy artifact policy | No standalone `security-design.md`, `security-applicability.md`, or `scripts/validate_security_design.ps1` is required for this active new-change archive. |

## Source of Truth Updated

The following source specs now reflect the archived behavior:

- `openspec/specs/sdd-design-workflow/spec.md`
- `openspec/specs/sdd-test-design-workflow/spec.md`
- `openspec/specs/sdd-review-security-workflow/spec.md`
- `openspec/specs/sdd-security-guideline-catalog/spec.md`
- `openspec/specs/sdd-execution-persistence-contracts/spec.md`

## Archive Read-Back Verification

Read-back verification after moving the folder confirmed:

- The active folder `openspec/changes/slim-secure-design-artifacts/` is gone.
- The archive folder `openspec/changes/archive/2026-07-06-slim-secure-design-artifacts/` exists.
- Required artifacts listed above exist in the archive folder.
- Five delta specs are preserved under archived `specs/`.
- `archive-report.md` is readable from the archived folder.
- `tasks.md` preserves 12/12 completed tasks and no unchecked implementation tasks.
- `review-report.md` preserves PASS WITH WARNINGS with 0 blocking failures.
- `review-security-report.md` preserves PASS WITH WARNINGS, 155 Source ID rows, 155 unique Source IDs, and no source-row blockers.
- `verify-report.md` preserves PASS WITH WARNINGS, `archiveReady: true`, 0 critical findings, 0 blocking findings, 8/8 compact rows, 155/155 exact-once source rows, and unavailable-tooling warnings.
- `design.md#secure-development-design` preserves compact SEC rows, `expectedSourceIdCount: 155`, safe-evidence policy, N/A policy, and `validation.status: pass`.

## SDD Cycle Complete

The change has been planned, implemented, reviewed, security-reviewed, verified, and archived. No next SDD phase is recommended.
