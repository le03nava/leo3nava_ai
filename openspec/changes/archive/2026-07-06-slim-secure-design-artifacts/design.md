# Design: Slim Secure Design Artifacts

## Technical Approach

Keep secure-design artifacts reviewable by moving exhaustive corporate Source ID inventory ownership to the shared catalog and exhaustive validation ownership to `review-security-report.md`. `design.md#secure-development-design` remains the active security contract, but it records compact `SEC-*` decisions, catalog identity, `expectedSourceIdCount: 155`, grouped coverage references, exact-once downstream validation rules, evidence owners, lifecycle state, and N/A/exception policy instead of materializing all 155 rows.

This change updates SDD instruction contracts and OpenSpec requirements only. The repository has no runtime application code, package manifest, or executable test runner; verification will rely on static/manual artifact checks.

## Architecture Decisions

### Decision: Catalog owns exhaustive inventory

**Choice**: Treat `skills/_shared/security-guideline-catalog.md#corporate-source-row-operational-inventory` as the authoritative 155 Source ID inventory.
**Alternatives considered**: Duplicating the full source matrix in every design or test-design artifact.
**Rationale**: Centralizing the inventory prevents drift and keeps design/test-design readable while preserving audit traceability through snapshot metadata and expected count.

### Decision: Design owns slim security contract by reference

**Choice**: Preserve compact `SEC-*` controls in design and add grouped source-row coverage metadata below them.
**Alternatives considered**: Making Source IDs replacement controls, or keeping standalone `security-design.md` / `security-applicability.md` in the active DAG.
**Rationale**: Compact controls remain the architectural security decision layer; source rows are operational evidence. New-change routing stays `design -> test-design`.

### Decision: Review-security owns exhaustive expansion

**Choice**: Require only `sdd-review-security` to expand and validate every expected Source ID exactly once in `review-security-report.md`.
**Alternatives considered**: Expanding rows in design, test-design, verify, and archive.
**Rationale**: One phase owning the full matrix reduces artifact bloat and prevents contradictory row verdicts across phases.

## Data Flow

```text
Catalog inventory (155 Source IDs)
        │
        ├─ referenced by design.md#secure-development-design
        │      compact SEC rows + grouped coverage refs + policies
        │
        ├─ consumed by test-design.md
        │      static/manual/automated evidence plan by group/mapping
        │
        └─ expanded by review-security-report.md
               exact-once Source ID matrix + verdicts + evidence
                       │
                       └─ verify/archive preserve summaries and links
```

## File Changes

| File | Action | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `skills/_shared/sdd-security-contract.md` | Modify | Clarify artifact boundary: catalog inventory, slim design references, test-design planning, review-security expansion, verify/archive preservation. |
| `skills/_shared/security-guideline-catalog.md` | Modify | State authoritative ownership of the 155 Source ID inventory, compact mappings, grouped references, and exact-count contract. |
| `skills/sdd-design/SKILL.md` | Modify | Require slim source-row coverage metadata and prohibit exhaustive matrix duplication in design. |
| `skills/sdd-test-design/SKILL.md` | Modify | Consume slim design coverage and plan evidence without requiring design to carry all rows. |
| `skills/sdd-review-security/SKILL.md` | Modify | Make review-security the exclusive active phase that materializes the exhaustive 155-row matrix. |
| `skills/sdd-archive/SKILL.md` | Modify | Preserve source-row summaries, mappings, warnings, exceptions, and links without duplicating the full matrix. |
| `agents/sdd/sdd-design.md` | Modify | Align adapter prompt with slim design source-row contract. |
| `agents/sdd/sdd-test-design.md` | Modify | Align adapter prompt with grouped coverage planning. |
| `agents/sdd/sdd-review-security.md` | Modify | Align adapter prompt with exclusive full expansion ownership. |
| `agents/sdd/sdd-archive.md` | Modify | Align adapter prompt with archive preservation boundary. |
| `openspec/specs/sdd-design-workflow/spec.md` | Modify | Sync accepted slim secure-design requirements at archive. |
| `openspec/specs/sdd-test-design-workflow/spec.md` | Modify | Sync accepted grouped source-row test planning requirements at archive. |
| `openspec/specs/sdd-review-security-workflow/spec.md` | Modify | Sync accepted exhaustive review-security expansion requirements at archive. |
| `openspec/specs/sdd-security-guideline-catalog/spec.md` | Modify | Sync accepted catalog inventory ownership requirements at archive. |
| `openspec/specs/sdd-execution-persistence-contracts/spec.md` | Modify | Sync accepted verify/archive source-row preservation requirements at archive. |

## Interfaces / Contracts

The active source-row boundary is:

```text
Catalog: authoritative inventory and compact mappings.
Design: compact SEC decisions + expected count + grouped coverage refs + policies.
Test-design: planned checks from slim coverage obligations.
Review-security: exhaustive exact-once Source ID expansion and validation.
Verify/archive: consume and preserve verdicts, summaries, warnings, exceptions, and links.
```

No new runtime API, CLI, or data contract is introduced.

## Testing Strategy

| Layer | What to Test | Approach |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Static/manual contract review | Design and skill/spec wording preserves slim artifact boundary, catalog ownership, expected count 155, exact-once rule, evidence owners, and no legacy standalone artifact dependency. | Manual diff inspection and artifact read-back. |
| Runtime unit/integration/e2e | Not applicable; repository has no detected test runner, package manifest, build command, or runtime application. | Record unavailable tooling explicitly in test-design and verify evidence. |
| Security review | Full Source ID expansion remains owned by `review-security-report.md`, not design. | `sdd-review-security` validates against catalog, design, test-design, apply evidence, changed files, and `review-report.md`. |

## Migration / Rollout

No data migration required. Rollout is documentation/contract-only and backward compatible with archived changes: legacy standalone `security-design.md` and `security-applicability.md` remain readable compatibility artifacts but are not active dependencies for new changes.

## Open Questions

None.

| `SEC-AUTH-001` | `Yes` / `planned` | Auth Source IDs are affected through validation-contract changes. | Catalog-owned grouped references; review-security expands exact-once. | test-design static/manual plan; review-security row verdicts. | none / none |
| `SEC-SESS-001` | `Yes` / `planned` | Session Source IDs are affected through coverage and review boundary changes. | Session rows stay catalog-owned; exhaustive verdicts live in review-security. | test-design plan; review-security exact-once validation. | none / none |
| `SEC-DATA-001` | `Yes` / `planned` | Safe-evidence policy affects sensitive-data/PAN evidence. | Use paths/sections/summaries only; no sensitive raw values in artifacts. | design policy; verify consumes review-security evidence. | none / none |
| `SEC-SECRET-001` | `Yes` / `planned` | Secret-safe evidence rules are preserved and clarified. | Never reproduce secret values; unsafe evidence blocks. | test-design safe-evidence checks; review-security rejection rules. | none / none |
| `SEC-ACCESS-001` | `Yes` / `planned` | Routing gates and blocker semantics affect access-control evidence. | Denial-by-default routing for missing/malformed/unsafe source-row evidence. | apply contract changes; archive blocker checks. | none / none |
| `SEC-FILE-001` | `Yes` / `planned` | File-based artifacts and reports are directly modified. | Store slim references in design; full matrix only in review-security. | apply modified Markdown; verify read-back. | none / none |
| `SEC-DB-001` | `Yes` / `planned` | DB Source IDs remain in the required catalog universe. | Preserve DB mappings by catalog reference and review-security expansion. | test-design static/manual check; review-security row verdicts. | none / none |
| `SEC-LOG-001` | `Yes` / `planned` | Logging/error evidence must remain review-safe. | Evidence links and observations must avoid sensitive operational details. | design policy; archive preserves safe links. | none / none |

Source-row coverage summary:

| Boundary | Design Decision |
| --- | --- |
| Inventory authority | `skills/_shared/security-guideline-catalog.md#corporate-source-row-operational-inventory` owns the 155 concrete Source IDs and compact mappings. |
| Expected universe | `expectedSourceIdCount: 155`; grouped references above cover sections 1-15 with counts totaling 155. |
| Exact-once rule | `sdd-review-security` expands catalog ranges and validates each expected Source ID exactly once in `review-security-report.md`. |
| Valid mappings | Only the eight catalog compact IDs are valid mappings. Unknown, missing, or empty mappings block. |
| Evidence owners | Design declares contract; test-design plans checks; apply implements contract edits; review-security expands/validates; verify consumes non-blocking verdicts; archive preserves summaries and links. |
| N/A / exception policy | `N/A` requires positive irrelevance evidence and justification; mandatory evidence gaps require complete approved exceptions. |
| Safe-evidence policy | Cite paths, sections, command summaries, sanitized observations, or redacted placeholders only. |
