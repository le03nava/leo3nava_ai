## Security Evidence

| Control | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `SEC-AUTH-001` | PASS |
| `SEC-SESS-001` | PASS |
| `SEC-DATA-001` | PASS |

| `SEC-LOG-001` | PASS |

Security evidence summary: 8/8 mandatory compact security controls covered; 0 exceptions. Corporate source-row validation is consumed from `review-security-report.md`: 155/155 exact-once rows, 0 missing, 0 duplicate, 0 unknown, safe evidence pass.

## Test-Design Coverage

| Case range | Result |
| --- | --- |
| TD-001 through TD-019 mandatory cases | PASS: 19/19 covered |
| TD-020 advisory case | PASS WITH WARNINGS: advisory warning evidence preserved |

## Warning Summary

| Warning | Blocking | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Runtime/build/lint/type/format/coverage tooling is unavailable by repository configuration, so evidence is static/manual. | No | `openspec/config.yaml#testing`; `review-report.md`; `review-security-report.md` |
| Git reports CRLF-to-LF normalization warnings for adapter prompt files. | No | `review-report.md`; `git diff --check` evidence |

## Archive Readiness

Archive readiness is true: tasks complete, general review non-blocking, security review non-blocking, formal verification passing with warnings only, 0 critical findings, 0 blocking findings, and source-row validation complete.
