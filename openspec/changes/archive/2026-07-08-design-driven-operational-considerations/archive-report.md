## Summary

Change `design-driven-operational-considerations` was archived after syncing seven delta specs into the OpenSpec source-of-truth specs and moving the active change folder to `openspec/changes/archive/2026-07-08-design-driven-operational-considerations/`.

Archive readiness was consumed from `verify-report.md`: `PASS WITH WARNINGS`, `archiveReady: true`, `criticalFindings: 0`, `blockingFindings: 0`, 15/15 tasks complete, and non-blocking general/security review reports. The only carried warning is unavailable runtime/build/lint/type/format/coverage tooling by repository configuration; this remains non-blocking because the change is Markdown instruction-contract work with complete static/manual evidence.

## Specs Synced

| Domain | Action | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sdd-design-workflow` | Updated | 2 modified requirements synced: `Operational Readiness Planning`, `Operational Evidence Safety in Design`. |
| `sdd-test-design-workflow` | Updated | 2 modified requirements synced: `Operational Readiness Test Planning`, `Operational Data Safety Checks`. Parser-safe wording uses operational checks, not readiness validation. |
| `sdd-review-workflow` | Updated | 2 modified requirements synced: `Operational Readiness General Review`, `Operational Review Handoff`. |
| `sdd-review-security-workflow` | Updated | 2 modified requirements synced: `Operational Evidence Leakage Review`, `Safe Placeholder Security Boundary`. |
| `sdd-execution-persistence-contracts` | Updated | 3 modified requirements synced: `Operational Readiness Evidence Persistence`, `Manual Operational Document Boundary`, `Final Documentation Restricted Data Boundary`. |
| `sdd-operational-readiness-workflow` | Updated | 1 added requirement, 3 modified requirements, and 1 removed requirement synced. Removal had explicit reason and migration in the delta. Parser-safe wording uses evidence assessment, not readiness assessment. |
| `sdd-security-guideline-catalog` | Updated | 2 modified requirements synced: `Operational Safe-Evidence Policy`, `Restricted Operational Data Classification`. |

No destructive merge blocker remains. The only removed requirement is `Mandatory Operational Readiness Evaluation`, and the delta records both reason and migration.

## Review and Verification Evidence

| Gate | Verdict | Blocking findings | Notes |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| General review | `PASS WITH WARNINGS` | 0 | `review-report.md` validates the fixed 96-control matrix, changed-file handoff, design-driven operational evidence, and unavailable tooling warning. |
| Security review | `PASS WITH WARNINGS` | 0 | `review-security-report.md` validates 8/8 compact `SEC-*` rows exactly once, 0 unknown IDs, 0 duplicates, 0 unsafe evidence findings, and no exceptions. |
| Verify | `PASS WITH WARNINGS` | 0 | `verify-report.md` confirms archive readiness, 15/15 tasks, 7/7 delta specs, 15/15 mandatory test-design cases, and no critical findings. |

## Source-Row and Security Audit Trail

Corporate source-row validation is not applicable for this change because the changed surface is Markdown SDD instruction contracts, shared safe-evidence wording, and active OpenSpec specs. `review-security-report.md#corporate-source-row-validation` records `sourceRowExpectedCount: null`, ownership-boundary PASS, no source-row blockers, no missing evidence rows, and no unsafe evidence rejections. The report intentionally links/summarizes the source-row section instead of copying a full matrix.

Catalog and compact-control audit trail:

- Catalog path: `skills/sdd-review-security/references/security-guideline-catalog.md`; active spec: `openspec/specs/sdd-security-guideline-catalog/spec.md`.
- Catalog snapshot inventory remains documented as 155 expanded Source IDs for applicable future corporate source-row changes; this change records source-row validation as N/A with rationale.
- Compact mappings consumed by security review: 8 expected compact rows, 8 materialized exactly once, 0 blockers.
- `N/A` evidence/justification status: source-row N/A is justified by `test-design.md#source-id-coverage-baseline` and `design.md#classification-and-changed-surface`; compact N/A rows include evidence locations and scope rationale in `review-security-report.md`.
- Exceptions: none.

No legacy standalone `security-design.md` artifact or `scripts/validate_security_design.ps1` execution was required for archive readiness.

## Operational Evidence Audit Trail

Operational evidence is design-driven for this change:

- `design.md#operational-considerations` records SDD-workflow operational considerations: preventing stale gates, preserving mechanism-oriented monitoring wording, safe evidence, manual operational-document boundary, and final-document-only value isolation.
- `test-design.md#operational-considerations-checks` defines static/manual checks for deleted stale authority, design-owned applicability, evidence traceability, safe placeholders, restricted-data absence, monitoring mechanisms, and manual operational document boundary.
- `review-report.md#design-driven-operational-evidence-review` confirms deleted stale authority, no active stale contract references, no mandatory readiness completeness gate, conditional design ownership, downstream evidence consumption, safe-evidence boundary, and mechanism-oriented monitoring wording.
- `review-security-report.md#operational-evidence-leakage-validation` confirms no unsafe operational evidence, exact `Pendiente de confirmar:` / `No aplica.` placeholders remain safe states, and final-document-only values are not backfilled into ordinary SDD evidence.
- `verify-report.md#warning-summary` carries unavailable tooling as a non-blocking warning.

Unresolved operational gaps: none beyond the explicit unavailable-tooling warning. `sdd-operational-doc` remains a manual post-archive utility and was not run or required for archive.

## Unavailable Tooling Warning

Repository configuration reports no test runner, build command, linter, type checker, formatter, or coverage command. Archive preserves this as warning-only evidence from `verify-report.md`; unavailable tooling was not treated as passing runtime evidence.

## Archive Verification Checklist

- Main specs synced before archive move: passed.
- Archive destination created: `openspec/changes/archive/2026-07-08-design-driven-operational-considerations/`.
- Active change folder removed from tracked OpenSpec change files: passed.
- Archived contents include proposal, specs, design, test-design, tasks, review-report, review-security-report, verify-report, and archive-report: passed.
- `design.md#secure-development-design` preserved: passed.
- General/security review evidence non-blocking: passed.
- Verify evidence passing with warnings and archive-ready: passed.
- Mandatory security evidence and safe-evidence references preserved: passed.
- Source-row blocker absence preserved: passed.
- Operational evidence, warning carry-forward, unavailable-tooling note, and manual `sdd-operational-doc` boundary preserved: passed.

## SDD Cycle Complete

The change has been fully planned, implemented, reviewed, security-reviewed, verified, synced to source-of-truth specs, and archived. Next recommended action: none.
