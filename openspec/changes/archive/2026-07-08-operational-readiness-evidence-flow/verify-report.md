## Summary

Verification passed with warnings. All implementation tasks in `tasks.md` are complete, required planning/review/security-review artifacts are readable, operational-readiness evidence is complete as safe evidence, exact `Pendiente de confirmar:`, or exact `No aplica.`, and both review gates are non-blocking. Runtime/build/test/lint/typecheck/format/coverage tooling remains unavailable per `openspec/config.yaml#testing`; this report preserves that as unavailable evidence, not as executed or passing command evidence.

## Task Completion

| Source | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tasks.md` implementation task checkboxes | PASS | No unchecked `- [ ]` task entries remain in the task artifact. Tasks 1.1-4.4 are checked complete. |
| Proposal success-criteria checklist | INFORMATIONAL | Proposal lines 64-67 remain acceptance criteria, not implementation task checkboxes; each criterion is verified through design/test-design/apply/review/security evidence below. |

## Review Evidence Consumed

| Report | Verdict | Blocking State | Warning Summary | Verify Consumption |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `review-report.md` | PASS WITH WARNINGS | 0 blocking failures | `WARN-001`: unavailable runtime/build/test/lint/type/format/coverage tooling. | Accepted as non-blocking prerequisite. Readiness review is outside the fixed 96-control matrix; matrix shape summary only, not duplicated here. |
| `review-security-report.md` | PASS WITH WARNINGS | Blockers: none | `WARN-SEC-001`: unavailable tooling must carry forward. | Accepted as non-blocking prerequisite. Security review owns compact/source-row matrices; this report consumes summaries only. |

## Source-Row Summary Consumed

| Item | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Catalog snapshot | PASS | `security-guidelines-initial-user-snapshot-2026-06-30` cited in `review-security-report.md#report-validation`. |
| Expected Source ID count | PASS | `sourceRowExpectedCount: 155`; `Expected Source ID count: 155`. |
| Exact-once Source ID coverage | PASS | Security review report validation states 155 Source ID rows from the catalog snapshot and no unknown/duplicate rows. Verification counted 155 numeric Source ID rows. |
| Compact mappings | PASS | 8 compact rows summarized: `SEC-AUTH-001`, `SEC-SESS-001`, `SEC-DATA-001`, `SEC-SECRET-001`, `SEC-ACCESS-001`, `SEC-FILE-001`, `SEC-DB-001`, `SEC-LOG-001`. |
| Safe evidence / N/A justification | PASS | Security review reports safe evidence policy passed, N/A justifications present for non-runtime surfaces, and unsafe evidence rejections: none. |
| Exceptions | PASS | None planned or required. |
| Blockers | PASS | Source-row blockers: none. |
| Warnings | PASS WITH WARNINGS | Warning-only: unavailable tooling, preserved below. |

## Tooling Evidence

| Tooling Area | Availability | Verification Handling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Runtime test runner | Unavailable | No runtime tests executed; static/manual Markdown contract evidence used. |
| Build command | Unavailable | No build executed; unavailable evidence preserved. |
| Unit/integration/e2e layers | Unavailable | No test layers executed; test-design coverage mapped to static/manual evidence. |
| Coverage command | Unavailable | No coverage executed; manual coverage mapping used. |
| Linter | Unavailable | No linter executed; manual Markdown inspection evidence consumed. |
| Type checker | Unavailable | No type checker executed; not applicable to Markdown-only contracts. |
| Formatter | Unavailable | No formatter executed; documentation-quality advisory evidence consumed. |

This repository is an AI agent/skill distribution with Markdown instruction contracts and no executable tooling configured. The launch envelope explicitly allows static/manual evidence for this Markdown-only contract change when mandatory evidence is complete and review warnings are non-blocking. No unavailable tool is represented as passing execution evidence.

## Operational Readiness Verification

| Required Area | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mandatory readiness evaluation | PASS | `skills/_shared/sdd-operational-readiness-contract.md` requires all categories to be evaluated; `design.md#operational-readiness` defines strategy and phase evidence. |
| Exact field states | PASS | Shared contract and phase skills require safe evidence, exact `Pendiente de confirmar:`, or exact `No aplica.`. Apply/review/security evidence confirms exact markers and no invention. |
| Logs and error evidence | PASS | Readiness/security contracts and `design.md#sensitive-logging-and-monitoring-rules` prohibit raw sensitive logs and require sanitized summaries/refs. |
| Monitoring mechanisms | PASS | Readiness contract, design, and test-design require mechanism-oriented monitoring and reject SQL-only assumptions by default. |
| Administration operations | PASS | Readiness contract and operational-doc template preserve quarantine/stop, restart/resume, periodic activities, or pending markers. |
| Reprocessing and recovery | PASS | Readiness contract and operational-doc template preserve reprocess/recovery evidence or pending markers. |
| Backup, retention, cleanup, generated artifacts | PASS | Readiness/security contracts require refs/summaries, not generated bytes; operational-doc template preserves backup/retention fields with pending/`No aplica.` behavior. |
| Product/support ownership and final document inputs | PASS | Readiness contract and operational-doc skill require pending markers for missing owners/final values and final-user-input-only restricted values. |
| Restricted operational data boundary | PASS | `review-security-report.md#operational-readiness-leakage-review` reports no restricted operational values, secrets, raw logs, payloads, full ID lists, generated bytes, PAN, PII, or confidential values accepted as SDD evidence. |
| Manual operational document boundary | PASS | `sdd-operational-doc` remains manual post-archive, archive-consuming, and not a DAG phase; final values are not backfilled into SDD evidence. |
| Warning carry-forward | PASS WITH WARNINGS | Unavailable-tooling warning carried from apply, review, and security review into this report for archive preservation. |

## Spec Compliance Matrix

| Capability / Requirement | Verification Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mandatory Operational Readiness Evaluation | PASS | Design, readiness contract, test-design TD-001/TD-002, tasks 1.1 and 4.1, apply evidence, review readiness section. |
| Safe SDD Evidence Boundary | PASS | Secure design, security contract, apply SEC-OP-001..009 evidence, security review leakage verdict. |
| Phase Ownership Model | PASS | Readiness contract phase ownership table; affected phase skills reference shared contract and own local gates. |
| Manual Operational Document Consumption | PASS | `sdd-operational-doc/SKILL.md` and template preserve manual post-archive behavior, sections 1-9, and diagrams R1-R4. |
| Operational Readiness Planning in Design | PASS | `design.md#operational-readiness`; `skills/sdd-design/SKILL.md` requires the section and exact states. |
| Operational Evidence Safety in Design | PASS | `design.md#safe-evidence-boundary`; `design.md#secure-development-design`; security review safe-evidence validation. |
| Operational Readiness Test Planning | PASS | `test-design.md` defines TD-001..TD-020, including static/manual fallback when no runtime runner exists. |
| Operational Data Safety Checks | PASS | TD-007, TD-008, TD-011, TD-017 plus security review leakage summary. |
| Operational Readiness General Review | PASS WITH WARNINGS | `review-report.md` validates readiness outside the 96-control matrix and carries only unavailable-tooling warning. |
| Operational Review Handoff | PASS | `review-report.md#changed-file-and-security-handoff-context`; security review consumed handoff refs. |
| Operational Evidence Leakage Review | PASS WITH WARNINGS | `review-security-report.md#operational-readiness-leakage-review`; warning-only unavailable tooling. |
| Safe Placeholder Security Boundary | PASS | Security review accepts exact placeholders as safe marker states while separately proving no leakage. |
| Operational Readiness Evidence Persistence | PASS | `sdd-post-apply-gates.md`, `sdd-verify/SKILL.md`, `sdd-archive/SKILL.md`, and this report preserve refs/warnings. |
| Manual Operational Document Boundary | PASS | Archive may proceed without running `sdd-operational-doc`; utility consumes archive evidence manually later. |
| Final Documentation Restricted Data Boundary | PASS | Final restricted values are allowed only when explicitly user-provided for the final manual document. |
| Operational Safe-Evidence Policy | PASS | Security/readiness contracts cover logs, monitoring mechanisms, admin, reprocessing, ownership, unresolved gaps, and final-document boundaries. |
| Restricted Operational Data Classification | PASS | Security contract and review-security report classify restricted operational values and found no unsafe accepted evidence. |

## Test-Design Coverage Matrix

| Test Design Cases | Coverage Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TD-001..TD-019 mandatory cases | PASS | `apply-evidence.md#td-coverage-summary` maps all mandatory TD cases to changed contracts/phase skills/review evidence. |
| TD-020 non-mandatory documentation quality | PASS WITH ADVISORY | Apply evidence records advisory coverage: headings, tables/checklists, ownership boundaries, and intentional Spanish operational-document template copy. |
| SEC-OP-001..SEC-OP-009 mandatory controls | PASS | `apply-evidence.md#security-evidence-summary`; `review-security-report.md` compact/source-row validation. |
| Runtime execution planned cases | UNAVAILABLE | No runtime/build/lint/type/format/coverage tooling exists; static/manual evidence is the planned substitute and warning carry-forward is preserved. |

## Security Evidence Matrix

| Control Area | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sensitive data and operational identifiers | PASS | Secure design rules, security contract safe-evidence policy, security review source rows and leakage verdict. |
| Secrets | PASS | No exception planned; secret values prohibited in SDD artifacts and review evidence. |
| Sensitive logging and monitoring | PASS | Raw logs/payloads prohibited; monitoring evidence is mechanism-oriented. |
| Files and generated artifacts | PASS | Generated bytes/full exports prohibited; refs/summaries required. |
| Exceptions | PASS | None planned or required. Future exceptions require complete approval fields. |
| Review-security matrix ownership | PASS | Compact/source-row matrices are owned by `review-security-report.md`; verify cites summaries only. |

## Design Coherence

| Design Decision | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Centralize readiness semantics in shared contract | PASS | `skills/_shared/sdd-operational-readiness-contract.md` exists and is referenced by affected phase skills. |
| Preserve SDD DAG and keep operational-doc manual | PASS | Post-apply/archive contracts and `sdd-operational-doc` keep the utility manual post-archive. |
| Use exact human markers | PASS | Exact `Pendiente de confirmar:` and `No aplica.` markers are required across readiness contracts, phase skills, and operational template. |
| Separate quality review from leakage review | PASS | `review-report.md` owns general readiness checks; `review-security-report.md` owns leakage/security rows. |

## Correctness Table

| Dimension | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Artifact readability | PASS | All required artifacts from the launch envelope were read. |
| Task completion | PASS | No unchecked task checkboxes in `tasks.md`. |
| Static/manual implementation evidence | PASS | Apply evidence covers TD-001..TD-020 and SEC-OP-001..009. |
| General review prerequisite | PASS WITH WARNINGS | Non-blocking warning only. |
| Security review prerequisite | PASS WITH WARNINGS | Source rows complete, no blockers, warning-only unavailable tooling. |
| Runtime evidence | PASS WITH WARNINGS | Runtime evidence is unavailable by configuration and preserved as warning, not execution proof. |
| Safe evidence | PASS | No unsafe operational values accepted in ordinary SDD evidence. |
| Archive readiness | PASS WITH WARNINGS | Eligible to archive because warnings are non-blocking and all mandatory evidence is complete. |

## Skipped / Degraded Dimensions

| Dimension | Reason | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Runtime test execution | No runner configured. | Warning only for this Markdown-only contract change; no command pass claimed. |
| Build execution | No build command configured. | Warning/unavailable evidence. |
| Lint/typecheck/format/coverage execution | No commands configured. | Warning/unavailable evidence. |
| Full review matrix duplication | Matrix ownership boundary. | Intentionally omitted; cited summary only. |
| Full security/source-row matrix duplication | Matrix ownership boundary. | Intentionally omitted; cited summary only. |

## Issues

### CRITICAL

None.

### WARNING

- `WARN-VERIFY-001`: Runtime/build/test/lint/typecheck/formatter/coverage tooling is unavailable per `openspec/config.yaml#testing`. This is acceptable for this Markdown-only contract change only as static/manual evidence with warning carry-forward; archive must preserve it as unavailable evidence.

### SUGGESTION

None.

## Final Verdict

`PASS WITH WARNINGS`.

Route to `archive`. The warnings are non-blocking, all implementation tasks are complete, operational readiness evidence is complete in allowed safe states, general/security reviews are non-blocking, source-row validation has 155 expected rows with no blockers, and unavailable tooling is explicitly preserved without being treated as passing runtime evidence.
