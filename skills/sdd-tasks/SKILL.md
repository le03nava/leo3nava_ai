> This skill is for the dedicated `sdd-tasks` executor only.

## Language Domain Contract

Follow `skills/_shared/language-domain-contract.md`.

## Purpose

You are a sub-agent responsible for creating the TASK BREAKDOWN. You take the proposal, specs, design with embedded secure development design, and test design, then produce a `tasks.md` with concrete, actionable implementation steps organized by phase.

## What You Receive

From the orchestrator:
- Change name
- Artifact store mode (`engram | openspec | hybrid | none`)
- Delivery strategy (`ask-on-risk | auto-chain | single-pr | exception-ok`)
- Review budget lines when already resolved (`review_budget_lines`; default `400` when omitted because delivery planning is deferred)
- Chain strategy when already resolved (`stacked-to-main | feature-branch-chain | pending`)
- Size exception state when already resolved (`approved | pending | none`)

## Phase Artifact Contract

Common backend mechanics: follow `skills/_shared/persistence-contract.md` through **Section B** (retrieval) and **Section C** (persistence) in `skills/_shared/sdd-phase-common.md`.

| Concern | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| Required inputs | Proposal, specs, design with mandatory `## Secure Development Design`, mandatory `test-design`, delivery context, and testing capabilities from the selected backend. Standalone `security-design.md` is legacy/read-only compatibility data only. |
| Produced artifact | `sdd/{change-name}/tasks` or `openspec/changes/{change-name}/tasks.md`. |
| Mutates | None outside the produced tasks artifact. |
| Test-design consumption | Tasks must derive implementation, testing, static/manual evidence, validation-metadata checks, verification, and warning work from `test-design.md`; omitted mandatory planned cases are blockers. |
| Security consumption | Applicable narrative security rules, review-security expectations, and evidence expectations from `design.md#secure-development-design` and `test-design.md` must be represented as tasks or complete approved exceptions. Exhaustive `N/A` rationale and lifecycle row status belong to `review-security-report.md`. |
| Review workload behavior | Preserve the Review Workload Forecast guard lines, resolved delivery strategy, chain strategy, size-exception field, and reviewable work-unit split. |
| Success routing | `next_recommended: apply`, including when the workload guard requires the orchestrator to resolve apply-time decisions. |
| Block routing | `next_recommended: resolve-blockers` for missing required inputs, missing embedded secure development design, test-design gaps, testing capability blockers, or persistence failure. Do not route new changes to standalone `security-design`. |

## Output Contract

Return the Section D envelope from `skills/_shared/sdd-phase-common.md`. Put the tasks summary in `detailed_report`.

Routing rules for `next_recommended`:
- **Successful tasks with no blocking workload decision**: return `next_recommended: apply`. The orchestrator normalizes this into state `nextRecommended: apply` before routing or persisting state.
- **Tasks created but workload decision is required**: return `next_recommended: apply`, include `Decision needed before apply: Yes`, and leave the blocker for the orchestrator's Review Workload Guard. Do not ask the user directly.
- **Blocked tasks**: return `next_recommended: resolve-blockers` and include the exact missing proposal, spec, embedded secure development design, test-design artifact, testing capability, or task validation issue in `risks` / `detailed_report`.
- **Partial persistence failure**: return `next_recommended: resolve-blockers` unless the same artifact can be safely retried without new user input.
- Do not return camelCase `nextRecommended` from the phase envelope. CamelCase is for status/state artifacts only.

## Decision Gates

| Situation | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Required proposal, spec, design, or test-design is missing | Return `blocked` with `next_recommended: resolve-blockers`; do not write tasks. |
| `design.md#secure-development-design` is missing for a new active change | Return `blocked` with `next_recommended: resolve-blockers`; do not write tasks. |
| Standalone `security-design.md` is missing for a new active change | Continue; do not require it. It is legacy/read-only compatibility data only. |
| Mandatory security control evidence from `design.md#secure-development-design` or `test-design.md` is not represented in tasks | Return `blocked` with `next_recommended: resolve-blockers`; do not drop mandatory security evidence. |
| Task draft contains vague, non-verifiable, or oversized tasks | Fix it before persistence; if it cannot be fixed, return `blocked` with `next_recommended: resolve-blockers`. |
| Review workload risk is `High` against the received review budget and chain strategy is missing | Set `Decision needed before apply: Yes` and `Chain strategy: pending`; do not ask the user directly. |
| Strict TDD is active | Include RED/GREEN/REFACTOR task ordering for affected behavior. |

## What to Do

### Step 1: Load Skills
Follow **Section A** from `skills/_shared/sdd-phase-common.md`.

### Step 2: Analyze the Design

From the design document, identify:
- All files that need to be created/modified/deleted
- The dependency order (what must come first)
- Testing requirements per component

From `test-design.md`, identify:
- Planned automated, manual, and static checks
- Mandatory cases that must become implementation, testing, or evidence tasks
- Non-mandatory cases that should become advisory evidence tasks when feasible
- Expected evidence that `sdd-apply` and `sdd-verify` will later consume

From mandatory `design.md#secure-development-design`, identify:
- Changed-surface classification, applicable narrative category rules, static/manual validation notes, catalog context, safe-evidence policy, residual risks, and complete approved exceptions.
- Expected evidence owners, review-security expectations, and implementation, verification, or archive evidence obligations for applicable rules.
- Implementation, apply-evidence, review-security, verification, or archive-evidence tasks needed to satisfy mandatory controls.

Also read testing capabilities when available:
- Engram: `sdd/{project}/testing-capabilities`
- OpenSpec: `openspec/config.yaml` `testing` section
- Hybrid: read both and apply the Hybrid Conflict Policy if they disagree
- None: use only current-session testing context provided by the orchestrator

Use testing capabilities to decide whether test-first RED/GREEN/REFACTOR tasks are required. Do not invent TDD tasks when Strict TDD is unavailable or disabled.

If runtime test, coverage, linter, type-checker, or formatter commands are unavailable, create static/manual evidence tasks and require later apply/verify reports to state the unavailable tooling explicitly.

### Step 3: Write tasks.md

**IF mode is `openspec` or `hybrid`:** Create the task file:

```
openspec/changes/{change-name}/
├── proposal.md
├── specs/
├── design.md
├── test-design.md
└── tasks.md               ← You create this; consumes design.md#secure-development-design
```

**IF mode is `engram` or `none`:** Do NOT create any `openspec/` directories or files. Compose the tasks content in memory; persist it only if the mode allows persistence.

#### Task File Format

```markdown
# Tasks: {Change Title}

## Review Workload Forecast

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Estimated changed lines | <rough estimate or range> |

|------|------|-----------|-------|
| 1 | <standalone deliverable> | PR 1 | <base branch; tests/docs included> |
| 2 | <standalone deliverable> | PR 2 | <immediate parent/base branch boundary; depends on PR 1 or independent> |

## Phase 1: {Phase Name} (e.g., Infrastructure / Foundation)

- [ ] 1.1 {Concrete action — what file, what change}
- [ ] 1.2 {Concrete action}
- [ ] 1.3 {Concrete action}

## Phase 2: {Phase Name} (e.g., Core Implementation)

- [ ] 2.1 {Concrete action}
- [ ] 2.2 {Concrete action}
- [ ] 2.3 {Concrete action}
- [ ] 2.4 {Concrete action}

## Phase 3: {Phase Name} (e.g., Testing / Verification)

- [ ] 3.1 {Write tests for ...}
- [ ] 3.2 {Write tests for ...}
- [ ] 3.3 {Verify integration between ...}

## Phase 4: {Phase Name} (e.g., Cleanup / Documentation)

- [ ] 4.1 {Update docs/comments}
- [ ] 4.2 {Remove temporary code}
```

### Task Writing Rules

Each task MUST be:

| Criteria | Example ✅ | Anti-example ❌ |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| **Specific** | "Create `internal/auth/middleware.go` with JWT validation" | "Add auth" |
| **Actionable** | "Add `ValidateToken()` method to `AuthService`" | "Handle tokens" |
| **Verifiable** | "Test: `POST /login` returns 401 without token" | "Make sure it works" |
| **Small** | One file or one logical unit of work | "Implement the feature" |

### Review Workload Forecast Rules

Before finalizing tasks, estimate whether implementation is likely to exceed the resolved session `review_budget_lines` (`additions + deletions`). This is a planning guard, not an exact diff count. If the orchestrator did not pass a budget because delivery planning is still deferred, use `400`.

Use available signals: number of files, phases, integration points, tests, docs, generated artifacts, migrations, and how many concerns the change crosses.

If the estimate is **High** or likely above the session review budget:

1. Mark `Chained PRs recommended` as `Yes`.
2. Split tasks into **work units** that can become chained or stacked PRs.
3. Each suggested PR must have a clear start, clear finish, verification, and autonomous scope.
4. Do not ask the user directly. If chain strategy is missing, set `Decision needed before apply: Yes` and `Chain strategy: pending`; the orchestrator owns user interaction. The valid strategies are:
   - **Stacked PRs to main** — each PR merges to main in order. Fast iteration, fix on the go. Best for speed-first teams and independent slices.
   - **Feature Branch Chain** — the feature/tracker branch accumulates the final integration; PR #1 targets the tracker branch, later PRs target the immediate previous PR branch so each child diff stays focused. Only the tracker merges to main. Best for rollback control and coordinated releases.
   Size exceptions are not chain strategies. If the delivery path is an approved large single PR, keep `Chain strategy: pending`, set `Size exception: approved`, and record the maintainer approval evidence in the orchestration state.
5. Use the received delivery strategy and any orchestrator-provided chain strategy to set `Decision needed before apply`:
   - `ask-on-risk`: `Yes` — orchestrator asks before apply.
   - `auto-chain`: `No` — orchestrator proceeds with the first slice using the chosen chain strategy.
   - `single-pr`: `Yes` — orchestrator must require `size:exception` before apply.
   - `exception-ok`: `No` — maintainer has accepted `size:exception`; set `Size exception: approved` and keep `Chain strategy: pending` unless a real chain strategy is also selected.

Do not bury this in prose. Put the forecast near the top of the tasks artifact so the user sees it before implementation starts.

The forecast MUST include these exact plain-text lines so downstream guards can match them literally:

```text
Decision needed before apply: Yes|No
Chained PRs recommended: Yes|No
Chain strategy: stacked-to-main|feature-branch-chain|pending
Size exception: approved|pending|none
Review budget lines: <number>
Review budget risk: Low|Medium|High
400-line budget risk: Low|Medium|High
```

You may keep the table for readability, but the plain-text lines are the guard contract. Keep `400-line budget risk` as a legacy compatibility line even when the active review budget is not 400; `Review budget risk` is authoritative for the current session.

For `feature-branch-chain`, suggested work units SHOULD name the intended base boundary: PR #1 base = feature/tracker branch; PR #2 base = PR #1 branch; PR #3 base = PR #2 branch. If a child PR would show previous PR changes, the base is wrong and must be retargeted/rebased before review.

### Phase Organization Guidelines

```
Phase 1: Foundation / Infrastructure
  └─ New types, interfaces, database changes, config
  └─ Things other tasks depend on

Phase 2: Core Implementation
  └─ Main logic, business rules, core behavior
  └─ The meat of the change

Phase 3: Integration / Wiring
  └─ Connect components, routes, UI wiring
  └─ Make everything work together

Phase 4: Testing
  └─ Unit tests, integration tests, e2e tests
  └─ Verify against spec scenarios

Phase 5: Cleanup (if needed)
  └─ Documentation, remove dead code, polish
```

### Step 4: Validate Tasks

Before persisting or returning, verify:

- Every task references concrete file paths or specific spec scenarios.
- Every task is specific, actionable, verifiable, and small enough for one session.
- Tasks are ordered by dependency.
- Testing/evidence tasks reference specific planned cases from `test-design.md` and scenarios from the specs.
- Security evidence tasks reference guideline IDs and controls from `design.md#secure-development-design` when required.
- Every mandatory planned case in `test-design.md` is represented by implementation, testing, or evidence work; omitted mandatory cases are blockers.
- Every mandatory applicable security guideline has implementation, test-design, apply, verify, archive evidence, or a complete approved exception represented in tasks.
- Static/manual validation notes, review-security evidence, archive evidence fields, and unavailable runtime/coverage/lint/typecheck/format reporting from `design.md#secure-development-design` / `test-design.md` are represented in tasks when applicable.
- The Review Workload Forecast includes the required plain-text guard lines.
- If `Review budget risk` or `400-line budget risk` is `High`, Suggested Work Units are present.
- If `feature-branch-chain` is selected, work units name the intended base boundaries.
- `size:exception` is represented only in `Size exception`, not as a `Chain strategy` value.
- The tasks artifact stays under the 530-word size budget.

### Step 5: Persist Artifact

**This step is MANDATORY for `engram`, `openspec`, and `hybrid` modes — do NOT skip it. In `none` mode, skip persistence.**

Follow **Section C** from `skills/_shared/sdd-phase-common.md`.
- artifact: `tasks`
- topic_key: `sdd/{change-name}/tasks`
- openspec path: `openspec/changes/{change-name}/tasks.md`
- type: `architecture`

### Step 6: Return Summary

Return the Section D envelope from `skills/_shared/sdd-phase-common.md`. Put this tasks summary in `detailed_report`:

```markdown
## Tasks Created

**Change**: {change-name}
**Location**: `openspec/changes/{change-name}/tasks.md` (openspec/hybrid) | Engram `sdd/{change-name}/tasks` (engram) | inline (none)

### Breakdown
| Phase | Tasks | Focus |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Phase 1 | {N} | {Phase name} |
| Phase 2 | {N} | {Phase name} |
| Phase 3 | {N} | {Phase name} |
| Total | {N} | |

### Implementation Order
{Brief description of the recommended order and why}

### Review Workload Forecast
- Estimated changed lines: {estimate or range}
- Review budget lines: {review_budget_lines}
- Review budget risk: {Low | Medium | High}
- 400-line budget risk: {Low | Medium | High}
- Chained PRs recommended: {Yes | No}
- Delivery strategy: {ask-on-risk | auto-chain | single-pr | exception-ok}
- Chain strategy: {stacked-to-main | feature-branch-chain | pending}
- Size exception: {approved | pending | none}
- Decision needed before apply: {Yes | No}
- Suggested work-unit PR split: {brief list or "Not needed"}

### Next Step
{Ready for implementation (sdd-apply) OR return `Decision needed before apply: Yes` so the orchestrator can resolve chained PRs before sdd-apply.}
```

## Rules

- ALWAYS reference concrete file paths in tasks
- Tasks MUST be ordered by dependency — Phase 1 tasks shouldn't depend on Phase 2
- Testing/evidence tasks should reference planned case IDs from `test-design.md` plus specific scenarios from the specs
- Security evidence tasks should reference guideline IDs from `design.md#secure-development-design` plus planned case IDs from `test-design.md`
- Mandatory `test-design.md` cases MUST NOT be omitted. If they cannot be represented in implementation tasks, return `blocked` and name the missing cases.
- Mandatory security controls MUST NOT be omitted. Missing mandatory evidence without a complete approved exception blocks task creation.
- Each task should be completable in ONE session (if a task feels too big, split it)
- Use hierarchical numbering: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, etc.
- NEVER include vague tasks like "implement feature" or "add tests"
- Apply any `rules.tasks` from `openspec/config.yaml`
- If Strict TDD is active, integrate test-first tasks: RED task (write failing test) → GREEN task (make it pass) → REFACTOR task (clean up)
- **Size budget**: Tasks artifact MUST be under 530 words. Each task: 1-2 lines max. Use checklist format, not paragraphs.
- **Review workload guard**: ALWAYS include the Review Workload Forecast. If likely above the session review budget, recommend chained PRs and honor the received delivery strategy for whether a decision/exception is needed before apply.
- Return the Section D envelope per `skills/_shared/sdd-phase-common.md`; the tasks summary belongs in `detailed_report`.
